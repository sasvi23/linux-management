### Level 2 Directories
A level 2 directory is a directory that is located immediately inside another directory, making it two levels deep in the overall file system structure.

I have typed the below command in order to get the level 2 directories in the command prompt.

From the directories I have selected,

- **/usr/bin**

- **/var/log**

- **/etc/ssh** 

- **/usr/local** 

- **/var/cache**

The directory structure of each level 2 directories can be requested as below.
