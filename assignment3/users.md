## Create users and use created users to test out file access permissions

####  Task point 1
- Created the tupu user using the adduser script.

- given a new password and skip on the additional details.

#### Task point 2
- Created the Lupu user using the useradd command.
- Created a user profile, home directory, and user group similar to Tupu.

- Since I have created the lupu user like the way I made the tupu, i had to ensure that the lupu group exists.

- With the detour I did previously, I had to Check if the home directory exists and has the correct ownership.

    - *Verify the lupu user's home directory and permissions*:
    ```
    1. First command - Check if the home directory exists and has the correct ownership and permissions.
        This command creates the home directory /home/lupu if it doesn't already exist.
    ```

    ```
    2. Second Command - This command changes the ownership of the /home/lupu directory and all its contents (recursively, due to the -R flag) to the user lupu and the group lupu.
    ```

    ```
     3. Third command - This command sets the permissions of the /home/lupu directory to 755. This means the owner (lupu) has read, write, and execute permissions, while the group and others have read and execute permissions.

- Ensure the lupu user is part of the lupu group.

#### Task point 3
- Created the Hupu system user with the login shell set to /bin/false.

<br><img src="images\adduser-hupu.png" width="2000" height="30"><br/>

```
To verify that the user hupu has been created correctly, you can check the /etc/passwd file or use the id command:
```

    - Check the /etc/passwd file
    - Check the ID

<br><img src="images\id-hupu.png" width="2000" height="40"><br/>

- This confirms that hupu was created successfully.

#### Task point 4
- Added the users Tupu and Lupu to the sudo users.

<br><img src="images\adding-users-to-sudo.png" width="2000" height="30"><br/>

#### Task point 5
- Created a directory /opt/projekti and add both users (Tupu and Lupu) as owners,with Only Tupu and Lupu should have access to list files in the directory, read, and modify them.

```
- Created the /opt/projekti directory:
- Created the projekti group:
- Added Tupu and Lupu to the projekti group:
- Change the group ownership of the /opt/projekti directory:
- Set the directory permissions to ensure only Tupu and Lupu can list, read, and modify files:
- Set the setgid bit on the directory to ensure new files and directories inherit the projekti group:
```

**How These Steps Match the Requirements**

*Create the directory:*

    > The command sudo mkdir -p /opt/projekti creates the /opt/projekti directory.

*Create a group of users:*

    > The command sudo groupadd projekti creates a group named projekti.

*Add users to the group:*

    > The commands sudo usermod -aG projekti tupu and sudo usermod -aG projekti lupu add Tupu and Lupu to the projekti group.

*Assign the group to the owner of the folder and files:*

    > The command sudo chown :projekti /opt/projekti changes the group ownership of the directory to projekti.

*Ensure only Tupu and Lupu have access:*

    > The command sudo chmod 770 /opt/projekti sets the permissions so that only the owner (root) and group members (Tupu and Lupu) have full access, while others have no access.

*Maintain the permission structure for new files and folders:*

    > The command sudo chmod g+s /opt/projekti sets the setgid bit, ensuring that any new files or directories created within /opt/projekti inherit the projekti group ownership.
